DeepLag: Discovering Deep Lagrangian Dynamics for Intuitive Fluid Prediction. See [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02425) or [Slides](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/555f0af33db0469ab610/).

This paper proposes using the combination of two perspectives in fluid dynamics, **Eulerian & Lagrangian**, to model the spatio-temporal evolution of fluids, and presents [DeepLag](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02425) as a practical Neural Fluid Prediction algorithm, which can bring the following benefits:

- Going beyond learning fluid dynamics at static grids, we propose DeepLag featuring the Eulerian-Lagrangian Recurrent Network, which integrates both Eulerian and Lagrangian frameworks from fluid dynamics within a pure deep learning framework concisely.
- Inspired by Lagrangian mechanics, we present EuLag Block, which can accurately track particle movements and interactively utilize the Eulerian features and dynamic information in fluid prediction, enabling a better dynamic modeling paradigm.
- DeepLag achieves consistent state-of-the art on three representative fluid prediction datasets with superior trade-offs for performance and efficiency, exhibiting favorable practicability.
